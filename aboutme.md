title: About me
subtitle: Why you'd want to fund my research
---

I am a Phd student doing interdisciplinary research at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, in the heart of Europe ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º. I am fascinated by work on the interface of Physics and Artificial Intelligence, and want to make advancements in both fields. On the Physics side, I want to contribute to the creation of an AI physicist. This is an autonomous AI system able to formulate theories from data and able to propose experiments to validate these theories. On the AI side, I use the tools of Physics to better understand how neural networks learn. Currently these neural networks are regarded as a black box, with the tools of Physics we can make them more transparent to make them more reliable and increase their performance. We can subdivide this overarching theme into multiple research questions:

- Make an AI to extract the degrees of freedom of a physical system. 
- Use information theory to better understand how neural networks learn. 

What else do you need?

### My history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
