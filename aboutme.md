subtitle: Why you'd want to fund my research
---

I am a Phd student doing interdisciplinary research at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, in the heart of Europe ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º. I am fascinated by work on the interface of Physics and Artificial Intelligence. The focus is creating an AI physicist, an AI system able to propose theories and propose experiments to validate them. The other side I try to use the tools of Physics to better understand how neural networks learn. We can subdivide this overarching theme into multiple research questions:

- Make an AI to extract the degrees of freedom of a physical system. 
- Use information theory to better understand how neural networks learn. 

What else do you need?

### My history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
