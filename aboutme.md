subtitle: Why you'd want to fund my research
---

I am a Phd student doing interdisciplinary research at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, in the heart of Europe ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º. I am fascinated by work on the interface of Physics and Artificial Intelligence, and want to make advancements in both fields. On the Physics side, I want to contribute to the creation of an AI physicist. This is an autonomous AI system able to formulate theories from data and able to propose experiments to validate these theories. On the AI side, I use the tools of Physics to better understand how neural networks learn. Currently these neural networks are regarded as a black box, with the tools of Physics we can make them more transparent to make them more reliable and increase their performance. 

### My history

I started my Master in Physics at the VUB because I wanted to understand how the world around us works. It still amazes me how most everyday phenomena can be explained by a set of simple laws and equations. During my Masters, I did an Erasmus to EPFL, Switzerland. It was during this time that I got more and more interested in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in particular. When I came back to Belgium, I did a project in Deep Learning in the MRI department of the UZ Jette. I was also very happy to perform a master thesis at the VUB, where I was able to apply Deep Learning to design components in Nanophotonics.
